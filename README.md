🚀 Portfolio Projects

This is a collection of projects I've built. I will be adding new projects weekly as part of an aggressive "job-ready" sprint.

### Project 1: Logistics OTD (On-Time Delivery) Analysis
Description: Analyzed a 32,000-row logistics dataset to find the *true* drivers of delivery delays.
Analysis & Insight:** Disproved several false hypotheses (e.g., `risk_classification`, `latitude`). Discovered that **longitude** was the key driver, proving that deliveries to coastal routes were significantly less efficient.
Skills Used: Excel, Pivot Tables, Data Cleaning (handling 32,000 messy rows), Data Grouping (Binning), Data Visualization (Pivot Charts).
**Final Insight:**

Project 2: Warehouse Efficiency Analysis
Description: Investigated the relationship between warehouse inventory levels and operational speed.
Analysis & Insight:** Proved that higher inventory levels directly correlate with increased `loading_unloading_time`. This identified a key operational bottleneck caused by warehouse congestion.
Skills Used:** Excel, Pivot Tables, Data Grouping (Binning), Pivot Charts.
